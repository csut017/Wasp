# Project Wasp

This is an attempt to develop an open source version of [BattleScribe](https://battlescribe.net/). While BattleScribe is nice, it doesn't appear to be under active development anymore. Which means there are no more updates to the product.

This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of BattleScribe in .Net, so that we can expand on it and add new functionality in future.
